## Introduction

- Recall from Signals and Systems, we know that a **system** is a process or a device that takes one or more signals as inputs and generates one or more signals as outputs. 

- The simplest systems are those with one input and one output, often called **single input single output (SISO) systems**. For example, a microphone may be viewed as a SISO system which has a single input (the acoustic pressure) which causes the diaphragm to vibrate and produce a single output (electrical voltage). 

- A system can have **multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO)**. For example, the stereo microphone has two inputs (typically, a left microphone and a right microphone) and generates two voltage signals as outputs. 

- Some fundamental properties of systems that you studied in signals and systems are: **linearity**, **time-invariance**, and **causality**. Please review your notes from signals and systems to ensure that you understand these properties. 

- In this course, we will almost exclusively study causal SISO systems that are linear and time-invariant (LTI for short). Such systems arise in all branches of engineering, e.g., electrical circuits, spring-mass systems, gear systems, and thermodynamics. See Chapter 2 of Nise for detailed modeling examples. 

- However, keep in mind that LTI systems are a mathematical modeling idealization. Real systems are never LTI. A resistor will burn if you apply too high voltage across it. A spring will break if you apply too high force. However, there are regimes under which some systems behave like LTI systems.  

- In this lecture, we will review frequency domain modeling of LTI systems. You have seen this material in Signals and Systems. The purpose of this review is to simply introduce the notation used in this course, in case it happens to be different from the notation used in Signals and Systems. You are strongly encouraged to review your notes on this topic.

## Simple example of a control system

We start by a simple example of designing the cruise control of a car to understand the objectives of control system design. This example is adapted from Khalil (Chapter 1).

Consider a car of mass $m$ moving at velocity $v(t)$. Assume that when the accelerator is pressed at an angle $u(t)$, the engine produces a thrust $K_e u(t)$, where $K_e$ is the engine gain. The car experiences friction, which is assumed to be $bv(t)$, where $b$ is the equivalent damping coefficient. In addition, there is air drag, rolling resistance, and other factors, all of which we model as **disturbance** $w(t)$. 

Then, by Newton's second law, the simplified model of the dynamics can be written as 
$$
  m \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = K_e u(t) - b v(t) + w(t)
$$
Note that this is a causal LTI system with two inputs: the control input $u(t)$ and the disturbance $w(t)$; and one output: the velocity $v(t)$. For simplicity, we assume that $w(t) = 0$, reducing the system to a SISO system.

The objective of the cruise control is as follows. Given a reference velocity $v_{\mathrm{ref}}$, design a control input $u(t)$ to ensure that actual velocity equals $v_{\mathrm{ref}}$ in steady state. 

The system designer knows the engine gain $K_e$, but the other parameters, mass $m$ and damping coefficient $b$, depend on operating conditions.

We will design a controller assuming some nominal values $\hat m$ and $\hat b$ for $m$ and $b$, respectively and then check how the system performs when these parameters take their true value.

### Open loop control {-}

The simplest control strategy is open-loop control in which we apply a step input $u(t) = N \IND(t)$, where the gain $N$ is chosen to ensure that the steady state output equals $v_{\mathrm{ref}}$. Note that the nominal dynamics are given by
$$
  \hat m \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = N K_e - b v(t).
$$
At steady state, $dv(t)/dt = 0$. Hence, to ensure that the steady-state value of $v(t)$ is $v_{\mathrm{ref}}$, we must choose $N$ such that
$$
  \frac{N K_e}{\hat b} = v_{\mathrm{ref}}
  \implies
   N = \frac{ v_{\mathrm{ref}} \hat b }{K_e}.
$$

When this control is applied to the actual system with the true parameters $m$ and $b$, the system dynamics are given by
$$
   m \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \hat b v_{\mathrm{ref}}  - b v(t).
$$
As before, at steady state $dv(t)/dt = 0$, so the steady state value of the velocity is given by
$$
  v_{\mathrm{ss}} = \frac{v_{\mathrm{ref}} \hat b}{b}
$$
which leads to a steady state error of
$$
  v_{\mathrm{ref}} - v_{\mathrm{ss}} = v_{\mathrm{ref}} \left(\frac{b - \hat b}{b}\right)
$$

### Closed-loop control {-}

In closed loop control, we assume that the speed is measured by a speedometer and the controller uses this measurement to determine the control input $u$. 

The simplest closed-loop strategy is that of *proportional controller*, where we apply a control input 
$$
  u(t) = \frac{v_{\mathrm{ref}} \hat b}{b} + K (v_{\mathrm{ref}} - v(t) )
$$
where $K$ is called the **feedback gain**. Under this control, the closed-loop system is given by (assuming $w(t) = 0$)
$$
  m \frac{d v(t)}{dt} = \hat b v_{\mathrm{ref}} + K K_e (v_{\mathrm{ref}} - v(t) ) - b v
  = -(b + K K_e) v(t) + (\hat b + K K_e) v_{\mathrm{ref}}
$$
At steady state, $dv(t)/dt = 0$, so we have
$$
  v_{\mathrm{ss}} = v_{\mathrm{ref}} \left(\frac{\hat b + KK_e}{b + K K_e}\right).
$$
Thus, the steady-state error is given by
$$
  v_{\mathrm{ref}} - v_{\mathrm{ss}}
  = \left( \frac{b - \hat b}{b + K K_e} \right) v_{\mathrm{ref}}.
$$

Comparing the steady-state error of open-loop and closed-loop control, we observe that the denominator $b$ is open-loop expression has been replaced by $b + K K_e$. If the feedback gain $K$ is designed to be large, then the steady-state error of closed-loop control will be much smaller than the steady-state error of open-loop control. This is the main advantage of feedback control: it provides robustness against errors in estimating the nominal model. 

In a real-system, we need to understand the impact of disturbances, measurement noise, and time-delay between applying a control input (increasing the throttle) and the actuation (increased thrust generated by the engine). For the most part, in this course we will ignore these practical constraints and focus on understanding the analysis and synthesis of control system under idealized assumptions.

## Unilateral Laplace Transforms


:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}
## <i class="bi bi-journal-text text-primary"></i> A comment about notation
In Signals and Systems, we used $u(t)$ to denote the step function. In this course, we will use $u(t)$ to denote the control input. So, to avoid confusion, we will use $\IND(t)$ to denote the step function. _Note that the book uses $u(t)$, which can get confusing, in my opinion._
:::

Recall that there are two types of Laplace transforms (LTs): bi-lateral or two-sided LTs and unilateral or one-sided LTs. In this course, we will work exclusively with unilateral LTs.

Also recall that for two-sided LTs, we need to worry about the ROC (region of convergence). For one-sided LTs, we never explicitly mention the ROC since it is always the right hand plane right to the rightmost pole. 

We will use the notation
$$f(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad\mathcal L\quad} F(s)$$
to denote a LT-pair. We will also use
$$F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{ f(t)\}$$
or
$$f(t) = \mathcal L^{-1}\{F(s)\}$$
when we want to explicitly write the LT or the inverse LT of a signal.

---

The basic formula for a unilateral LT is
$$F(s) = \int_{0-}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt.$$
The inverse Laplace transform is given by
$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi j} \int_{\sigma - j \infty}^{\sigma + j \infty} F(s) e^{st} ds$$
where $\sigma$ is chosen such that $(\sigma,0)$ is in the ROC. 

In this course, we will **never** explicitly use these formulas to compute LTs. We will **always** use LT tables. You do not need to memorize the LT table; one will be provided during the examples. What you do need is the understanding of how to use the LT tables to compute LTs of complicated expressions and to compute inverse LTs using partial fraction expansion.

I will not review this material in class. Please go back to your SS notes or review Sec 2.1--2.2 of the textbook. It is important to understand the following three cases:

1. Roots of the denominator are real and distinct
2. Roots of the denominator are complex and distinct
3. Roots of the denominator are real and repeated. 


## The Transfer Function

Consider an LTI system with input $u(t)$ (also called the reference signal sometimes) and output $y(t)$. We can also represent this as the following block diagram:

![An LTI System](figures/svg/interconnect1.svg){#fig-LTI}

All such systems can be represented by constant coefficient linear differential equations (LDE) of the form
$$
a_n \frac{d^n y(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1} y(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \cdots  a_0 y(t)
= b_m \frac{d^m u(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \frac{d^{m-1} u(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \cdots + b_0 u(t).
$$

- This differential equation is called **linear** because there are no non-linear or multiplicative terms of the form $\displaystyle \left(\frac{d^3 y(t)}{dt^3}\right)\left(\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}\right)$. 

- It is called **constant coefficient** because the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_m$ are constants that do not depend on time.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between constant coefficient LDE and an LTI system. That is, every LTI system can be described by a constant coefficient LDE and vice-versa. 

Recall that a key defining property of an LTI system is its impulse response, which we will typically denote by $g(t)$ and the transfer function, which we denote by $G(s)$. Recall that $g(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal L \quad} G(s)$. 

Now an interesting feature of a constant coefficient LDE is that we can identify the transfer function simply by inspection. 

![An LTI System](figures/svg/interconnect2.svg){#fig-LTI-s}

Given an LTI system with input $u(t)$ and output $y(t)$, we know that
$$Y(s) = G(s)U(s).$$
Therefore, if we know the input and output, we can identify the transfer function using
$$ G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}.$$
Now, if we go back to the general formula of a constant coefficient LDE 
$$
a_n \frac{d^n y(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1} y(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \cdots  a_0 y(t)
= b_m \frac{d^m u(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \frac{d^{m-1} u(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \cdots + b_0 u(t).
$$
and assume that the system starts from zero-initial state and take the LT of both sides, we get
$$
a_n s^n Y(s) + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} Y(s) + \cdots + a_0 Y(s)
=
b_m s^m U(s) + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} U(s) + \cdots + b_m U(s).
$$
Rearranging terms, we get
$$
(a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0) Y(s)
=
(b_m s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0) U(s).
$$
Therefore,
$$
G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}
= \frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_m}
{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0}.
$$
Thus, we can easily go back and forth between the DE and the transfer function.

:::

In this course, we will assume that the system is specified either as a LDE or as a TF. The textbook provides detailed examples of how to derive either the LDE or the TF from a physical system such as an electric circuit or a spring-mass system. 

We present an alternative representation of the TF (pole-zero plot) in the next section. Later in the course we will also study other equivalent forms of representing the system such as state space equations and Bode plots.

A final remark. In all the systems that we consider in this course, we will assume that $m < n$. So, the denominator of the TF has a strictly higher degree than the numerator. Such transfer functions are called **proper**. It is possible to have causal systems where $m=n$ but we will not consider that in this course. As a consequence, when we consider state space representation in future lectures, we will get formulas which are simpler than more general formulas which you may find at other sources. 

## Poles and Zeros of a Transfer Function

The TF of an LTI system is always of the form:
$$
G(s) 
= \frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_m}
{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0}.
$$

Both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials in $s$. So, we can factorize them and write the TF as 
$$
G(s) 
= K
\frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2) \cdots (s - z_m)}
{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)\cdots (s-p_n)}.
$$

- The roots of the numerator are called **zeros** (because $G(z_i) = 0$). 
- The roots of the denominator are called **poles** (because $G(p_i) = \infty$ and if we plot $G(s)$ it will have a peak going to $∞$ at $p_i$; this peak looks like a pole). 
- The constant $K$ is called the **gain** (because, when none of the poles and zeros are at origin, the step response of $G(s)$ will have a steady state value of $K$). 

We often represent the poles and zeros using a **pole-zero plot.**

```{ojs}
PZplot = function(zeros, poles, xdomain, ydomain) {
  return Plot.plot({
    grid: true,
    x: { domain: xdomain},
    y: { domain: ydomain},

    marks: [
      // Axes
      Plot.ruleX([0]),
      Plot.ruleY([0]),
      // Data
      Plot.dot(zeros, {x:"σ", y:"jω", r: 5}),
      Plot.dot(poles, {x:"σ", y:"jω", symbol: "times", r: 5}),
    ]
  })
}
```

::: {#exm-pole-zero}
#### Pole-zero plot
Consder
$$G(s) = \frac{s+2}{(s+1)^2 + 1^2}.$$
The poles are $-1 \pm j$ and the zero is $-2$. The pole-zero plot is shown below, where the location of the pole is represented by a "cross" and the location of the zero is represented by a "circle". 

```{ojs}
PZplot(
       [ {σ: -2, jω: 0} ], 
       [ { σ: -1, jω: -1 }, {σ: -1, jω: 1 } ],
       [-3, 3],
       [-3, 3],
      )
```
:::

Since the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of $G(s)$ have real coefficients, the roots are either real or occur in complex conjugate pairs. So, the poles and zeros either lie on the $σ$-axis or are symmetric about the $σ$-axis. 

Note that the pole-zero plot does not capture the gain of the TF. 


## BIBO Stability

Recall from Signals and Systems that an LTI system with impulse response $g(t)$ is BIBO stable if
$$
\int_{-∞}^{∞} |g(t)| dt < \infty.
$$

For a causal system (i.e., a system for which $g(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$), this is equivalent to 
$$
\int_{0^{-}}^{∞} |g(t)| dt < ∞.
$$

This implies that for any $σ \in \reals$, $σ > 0$, we have 
$$
\int_{0^{-}}^{∞} |g(t)| e^{-σt} dt < ∞. 
$$

Therefore, there can be no pole in the open right hand plane $\{ (σ + j ω) : σ > 0 \}$. Thus, we have the following:

> A causal LTI system is stable if all poles are in the open left hand plane. 

```{ojs}

PZplot(
       [ {σ: 1.5, jω: 0} ], 
       [ { σ: -1, jω: -1 }, {σ: -1, jω: 1 }, {σ: -1.5, jω: 0} ],
       [-2, 2],
       [-2, 2],
      )

PZplot(
       [ {σ: -1.5, jω: 0} ], 
       [ { σ: -1, jω: -1 }, {σ: -1, jω: 1 }, { σ: 1.5, jω: 0 } ],
       [-2, 2],
       [-2, 2],
      )

PZplot(
       [ {σ: 1.5, jω: 0} ], 
       [ { σ: -1, jω: -1 }, {σ: -1, jω: 1 }, {σ: 0, jω: 0} ],
       [-2, 2],
       [-2, 2],
      )

PZplot(
       [ {σ: 1.5, jω: 0} ], 
       [ { σ: -1, jω: -1 }, {σ: -1, jω: 1 }, {σ: -0.02, jω: 0}, {σ: 0.02, jω: 0} ],
       [-2, 2],
       [-2, 2],
      )

```

If there are poles on the $j ω$ axis and the poles have multiplicity 1, then the system is **marginally stable**; if poles have multiplicity greater than 1, then the system is unstable.

In the next lecture, we will see how to use the poles to identify the step response of the system.

## Step Response

One of the configurations that we will really focus on in the course is the output of a _stable_ system when the **input is a step function.** This is often the case when we specify a reference input such as the desired temperature of a room or the desired speed in cruise control of a car, and are interested in seeing if we get a "good" output. Note that this question is only of interest for stable systems. If the system is unstable, then the output will go to infinity. 

As an example, consider the system of @exm-LDE-TF. What is the output when the input is a step function (assuming that the system starts from a zero initial state)?

To compute this, recall
$$
\IND(t) \xleftrightarrow{\quad \mathcal L\quad} \frac 1s.
$$

Thus, $U(s) = 1/s$. We had already identified that $G(s) = 1/(s+2)$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
Y(s) &= G(s) U(s) \\
     &= \frac{1}{s(s+2)} \\
     &= \frac{ \frac 12 }{s} - \frac{ \frac 12 }{ s + 2 }
     \quad \text{[By partial fraction expansion]}.
\end{align*}
Thus,
$$
  y(t) = \left[ \frac 12 - \frac 12 e^{-2t} \right] \IND(t).
$$

We can verify this by simulation.[^code]

```{julia}
#| echo: true
using ControlSystems, Plots

G = zpk([], [-2], 1)
T = 4

plot(step(G, T), label=L"G(s)", size=(500,250))
```

[^code]: In the lab, we will use Matlab for simulating LTI systems. However, in the course notes, I use Julia which makes it easier to directly include the output in a webpage. 

## Interconnection of LTI Systems

There are three common ways to inter connect LTI systems shown below.

![Cascade Connection equivalent to $G_1(s)G_2(s)$.](figures/svg/interconnect3.svg){#fig-cascade}

![Parallel Connection equivalent to $G_1(s) + G_2(s)$.](figures/svg/interconnect4.svg){#fig-parallel}

![Feedback Connection equivalent to $\displaystyle \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}$.](figures/svg/interconnect5.svg){#fig-feedback}

## Time-delay systems

In a real system, there is often a delay between input and output, which is often modeled by a delay block whose output $y(t)$ is a delayed version of the input $u(t)$, by a delay time $τ$, that is
$$
  y(t) = u(t-τ).
$$
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get
$$
Y(s) = e^{-τs}U(s).
$$
Therefore, the TF of time-delay unit is $e^{-τs}$, which is different from the TFs studied so far as it is not a rational polynomial of $s$. It is possible to approximate $e^{-τs}$ using a rational polynomial using what is called [**Padé approximation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pad%C3%A9_approximant):

- **First-order Padé approximation:**
  $$ e^{-τs} \approx \dfrac{1 - τs/2}{1 + τs/2}. $$

- **Second-order Padé approximation:**
  $$ e^{-τs} \approx \dfrac{1 - τs/2 + (τs)^2/12}{1 + τs/2 + (τs)^2/12}. $$

We will not study time-delay systems in the course.
