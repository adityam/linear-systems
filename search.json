The purpose of this review is to simply introduce the notation used in this course, in case it happens to be different from the notation used in Signals and Systems.

    "text": "Unilateral Laplace Transforms\nRecall that there are two types of Laplace transforms (LTs): bi-lateral or two-sided LTs and unilateral or one-sided LTs. In this course, we will work exclusively with unilateral LTs.\nAlso recall that for two-sided LTs, we need to worry about the ROC (region of convergence). For one-sided LTs, we never explicitly mention the ROC since it is always the right hand plane right to the rightmost pole.\nWe will use the notation \\[f(t) \\xleftrightarrow{\\quad\\mathcal L\\quad} F(s)\\] to denote a LT-pair. We will also use \\[F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t)\\}\\] or \\[f(t) = \\mathcal L^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}\\] when we want to explicitly write the LT or the inverse LT of a signal.\n\nThe basic formula for a unilateral LT is \\[F(s) = \\int_{0-}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt.\\] The inverse Laplace transform is given by \\[f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{\\sigma - j \\infty}^{\\sigma + j \\infty} F(s) e^{st} ds\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is chosen such that \\((\\sigma,0)\\) is in the ROC.\nIn this course, we will never explicitly use these formulas to compute LTs. We will always use LT tables. You do not need to memorize the LT table; one will be provided during the examples. What you do need is the understanding of how to use the LT tables to compute LTs of complicated expressions and to compute inverse LTs using partial fraction expansion.\nI will not review this material in class. Please go back to your SS notes or review Sec 2.1–2.2 of the textbook. In is important to understand the following three cases:\n\nRoots of the denominator are real and distinct\nRoots of the denominator are complex and distinct\nRoots of the denominator are real and repeated."

    "section": "The Transfer Function",
    "text": "The Transfer Function\nIn this course, we will work exclusively with LTI systems. Such systems arise in all branches of engineering, e.g., electrical circuits, spring-mass systems, gear systems, and thermodynamics. See Chapter 2 of Nice for detailed modeling examples.\nConsider an LTI system with input \\(r(t)\\) (also called the reference signal sometimes) and output \\(c(t)\\). We can also represent this as the following block diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An LTI System\n\n\n\nAll such systems can be represented by constant coefficient linear differential equations (LDE) of the form \\[\na_n \\frac{d^n c(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \\frac{d^{n-1} c(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \\cdots  a_0 c(t)\n= b_m \\frac{d^m r(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \\frac{d^{m-1} r(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \\cdots + b_0 r(t).\n\\]\n\nThis differential equation is called linear because there are no non-linear or multiplicative terms of the form \\(\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{d^3 c(t)}{dt^3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^2 c(t)}{dt^2}\\right)\\).\nIt is called constant coefficient because the coefficients \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_m\\) are constants that do not depend on time.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between constant coefficient LDE and an LTI system. That is, every LTI system can be described by a constant coefficient LDE and vice-versa.\nRecall that a key defining property of an LTI system is its impulse response, which we will typically denote by \\(g(t)\\) and the transfer function, which we denote by \\(G(s)\\). Recall that \\(g(t) \\xleftrightarrow{\\quad \\mathcal L \\quad} G(s)\\).\nNow an interesting feature of a constant coefficient LDE is that we can identify the transfer function simply by inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An LTI System\n\n\n\nGiven an LTI system with input \\(r(t)\\) and output \\(c(t)\\), we know that \\[C(s) = G(s)R(s).\\] Therefore, if we know the input and output, we can identify the transfer function using \\[ G(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}.\\] Now, if we go back to the general formula of a constant coefficient LDE \\[\na_n \\frac{d^n c(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \\frac{d^{n-1} c(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \\cdots  a_0 c(t)\n= b_m \\frac{d^m r(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \\frac{d^{m-1} r(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \\cdots + b_0 r(t).\n\\] and assume that the system starts from zero-initial state and take the LT of both sides, we get \\[\na_n s^n C(s) + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} C(s) + \\cdots + a_0 C(s)\n=\nb_m s^m R(s) + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} R(s) + \\cdots + b_m R(s).\n\\] Rearranging terms, we get \\[\n(a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0) C(s)\n=\n(b_m s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_0) R(s).\n\\] Therefore, \\[\nG(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\n= \\frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_m}\n{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0}.\n\\] Thus, we can easily go back and forth between the DE and the transfer function.\n\nExercise 1 Find the transfer function corresponding to the following LDE \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}c(t) + 2 c(t) = r(t)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom inspection, we have \\[G(s) = \\frac{1}{s + 2}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Find a LDE that implements the following TF \\[\nG(s) = \\frac{2s+1}{s^2 + 2s + 3}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom inspection, we have \\[\n\\frac{d^2c(t)}{dt} + 2\\frac{d c(t)}{dt} + 3c(t) = 2\\frac{d r(t)}{dt} + r(t).\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will assume that the system is specified either as a LDE or as a TF. The textbook provides detailed examples of how to derive either the LDE or the TF from a physical system such as an electric circuit or a spring-mass system.\nWe present an alternative representation of the TF (pole-zero plot) in the next section. Later in the course we will also study other equivalent forms of representing the system such as state space equations and Bode plots.\nA final remark. In all the systems that we consider in this course, we will assume that \\(m &lt; n\\). So, the denominator of the TF has a strictly higher degree than the numerator. Such transfer functions are called proper. It is possible to have causal systems where \\(m=n\\) but we will not consider that in this course. As a consequence, when we consider state space representation in future lectures, we will get formulas which are simpler than more general formulas which you may find at other sources."

In particular, to obtain a dominant pole approximation of a system with poles \\(\\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}\\), we split the poles into two sets \\(\\mathcal P_d = \\{p_1, \\dots, p_k\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal P_r = \\{p_{k+1}, \\dots, p_n\\}\\) which has the following property: every pole \\(p_i\\) in \\(\\mathcal P_d\\) dominates every pole \\(p_j\\) in \\(\\mathcal P_r\\). Then, the dominant pole approximation ignores all the poles in the set \\(\\mathcal P_r\\).\n\nExample 1 Consider the system \\[\n  G(s) = \\frac{10}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+10)}.\n\\] In this case, the pole at \\(-10\\) is dominated by both poles \\(\\{-1,-2\\}\\).

Note that the pole at \\(-1\\) does not dominate the pole at \\(-4\\), and the pole at \\(-4\\) does not dominate the pole at \\(-10\\).

Suppose we are designing the cruise controller of a car and have an option of the following three controllers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Pole Zero Plot\n\n\n\nStep responses of three different systems\n\nIt is clear from the above plots that the transient response of the system matters as well. For a higer order system, finding the relationship between the location of the poles and the transient response can be difficult. To circumvent this difficulty, our general design philosophy will be as follows:\n\nWe will first understand the relationship between the location of the poles and the transient behavior of a first and second order system.\nLater, when it comes to system design, we will place the poles of the closed loop system such that the dominant pole approximation of the system is equivalent to a second order system."

Thus,\n\n\\(τ = \\dfrac{1}{a} = 0.02\\).\n\\(T_r = \\dfrac{2.2}{a} = 2.2 τ = 0.044\\) s.\n\\(T_s = \\dfrac{4}{a} = 4 τ = 0.08\\) s."

We will do such an experiment in Lab 3. In such cases, we can identify that the system is first order from the following features:\n\nno overshoot\nnon-zero initial slope.\n\nFor a first order system, we need to identify two parameters: \\(K\\) and \\(a\\).\n\nThe gain \\(K\\) is equal to the final value of the step response.\nTo identify \\(a\\), we identify the time constant \\(τ=1/a\\) as the time where the step response is \\(0.63K\\).\n\nThen, the TF is \\[ G(s) = K \\frac{a}{s+a}. \\]\n\nExample 4 Identify the transfer function from the following step response\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is no overshoot and the initial slope is non-zero, this is the step response of a first order system.\n\nThe final DC value of response is \\(2.5\\).

The whole point of dropping the lowest two assignments/labs is to reduce the administrative overhead of keeping track of such missed assignments/labs.\n\n\nRight to submit in English or French written work that is to be graded.\n\nIn accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nMcGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see McGill’s guide to academic honesty for more information).\nL’université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l’on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le Code de conduite de l’étudiant et des procédures disciplinaires (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le guide pour l’honnêteté académique de McGill.)"
