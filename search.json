    "text": "1.1 Unilateral Laplace Transforms\nRecall that there are two types of Laplace transforms (LTs): bi-lateral or two-sided LTs and unilateral or one-sided LTs. In this course, we will work exclusively with unilateral LTs.\nAlso recall that for two-sided LTs, we need to worry about the ROC (region of convergence). For one-sided LTs, we never explicitly mention the ROC since it is always the right hand plane right to the rightmost pole.\nWe will use the notation \\[f(t) \\xleftrightarrow{\\quad\\mathcal L\\quad} F(s)\\] to denote a LT-pair. We will also use \\[F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t)\\}\\] or \\[f(t) = \\mathcal L^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}\\] when we want to explicitly write the LT or the inverse LT of a signal.\nThe basic formula for a unilateral LT is \\[F(s) = \\int_{0-}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt.\\] The inverse Laplace transform is given by \\[f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{\\sigma - j \\infty}^{\\sigma + j \\infty} F(s) e^{st} ds\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is chosen such that \\((\\sigma,0)\\) is in the ROC.\nIn this course, we will never explicitly use these formulas to compute LTs. We will always use LT tables. You do not need to memorize the LT table; one will be provided during the examples. What you do need is the understanding of how to use the LT tables to compute LTs of complicated expressions and to compute inverse LTs using partial fraction expansion.\nI will not review this material in class.

    "section": "1.2 The Transfer Function",
    "text": "1.2 The Transfer Function\nIn this course, we will work exclusively with LTI systems. Such systems arise in all branches of engineering, e.g., electrical circuits, spring-mass systems, gear systems, and thermodynamics. See Chapter 2 of Nice for detailed modeling examples.\nConsider an LTI system with input \\(r(t)\\) (also called the reference signal sometimes) and output \\(c(t)\\). We can also represent this as the following block diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    input[\"r(t)\"] --&gt; system[LTI System] --&gt; output[\"c(t)\"]\n\nclassDef noBox fill:none,stroke:none; \nclass input noBox;\nclass output noBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll such systems can be represented by constant coefficient linear differential equations (LDE) of the form \\[\na_n \\frac{d^n c(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \\frac{d^{n-1} c(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \\cdots  a_0 c(t)\n= b_m \\frac{d^m r(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \\frac{d^{m-1} r(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \\cdots + b_0 r(t).\n\\]\n\nThis differential equation is called linear because there are no non-linear or multiplicative terms of the form \\(\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{d^3 c(t)}{dt^3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^2 c(t)}{dt^2}\\right)\\).\nIt is called constant coefficient because the coefficients \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_m\\) are constants that do not depend on time.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between constant coefficient LDE and an LTI system. That is, every LTI system can be described by a constant coefficient LDE and vice-versa.\nRecall that a key defining property of an LTI system is its impulse response, which we will typically denote by \\(g(t)\\) and the transfer function, which we denote by \\(G(s)\\). Recall that \\(g(t) \\xleftrightarrow{\\quad \\mathcal L \\quad} G(s)\\).\nNow an interesting feature of a constant coefficient LDE is that we can identify the transfer function simply by inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    input[\"R(s)\"] --&gt; system[\"G(s)\"] --&gt; output[\"C(s)\"]\n\nclassDef noBox fill:none,stroke:none; \nclass input noBox;\nclass output noBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven an TLI system with input \\(r(t)\\) and output \\(c(t)\\), we know that \\[C(s) = G(s)R(s).\\] Therefore, if we know the input and output, we can identify the transfer function using \\[ G(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}.\\] Now, if we go back to the general formula of a constant coefficient LDE \\[\na_n \\frac{d^n c(t)}{dt^n}  + a_{n-1} \\frac{d^{n-1} c(t)}{dt^{n-1}} + \\cdots  a_0 c(t)\n= b_m \\frac{d^m r(t)}{dt^m} + b_{m-1} \\frac{d^{m-1} r(t)}{dt^{m-1}} + \\cdots + b_0 r(t).\n\\] and assume that the system starts from zero-initial state and take the LT of both sides, we get \\[\na_n s^n C(s) + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} C(s) + \\cdots + a_0 C(s)\n=\nb_m s^m R(s) + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} R(s) + \\cdots + b_m R(s).\n\\] Rearranging terms, we get \\[\n(a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0) C(s)\n=\n(b_m s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_0) R(s).\n\\] Therefore, \\[\nG(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\n= \\frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_m}\n{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0}.\n\\] Thus, we can easily go back and forth between the DE and the transfer function.\n\nExercise 1.1 Find the transfer function corresponding to the following LDE \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}c(t) + 2 c(t) = r(t)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom inspection, we have \\[G(s) = \\frac{1}{s + 2}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2 Find a LDE that implements the following TF \\[\nG(s) = \\frac{2s+1}{s^2 + 2s + 3}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom inspection, we have \\[\n\\frac{d^2c(t)}{dt} + 2\\frac{d c(t)}{dt} + 3c(t) = 2\\frac{d r(t)}{dt} + r(t).\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will assume that the system is specified either as a LDE or as a TF. The textbook provides detailed examples of how to derive either the LDE or the TF from a physical system such as an electric circuit or a spring-mass system.\nWe present an alternative representation of the TF (pole-zero plot) in the next section. Later in the course we will also study other equivalent forms of representing the system such as state space equations and Bode plots.\nA final remark. In all the systems that we consider in this course, we will assume that \\(m &lt; n\\). So, the denominator of the TF has a strictly higher degree than the numerator. Such transfer functions are called proper. It is possible to have causal systems where \\(m=n\\) but we will not consider that in this course. As a consequence, when we consider state space representation in future lectures, we will get formulas which are simpler than more general formulas which you may find at other sources.",

The roots of the denominator are called poles (because \\(G(p_i) = \\infty\\) and if we plot \\(G(s)\\) it will have a peak going to \\(∞\\) at \\(p_i\\); this peak looks like a pole). The constant \\(K\\) is called the gain (because, when none of the poles and zeros are at origin, the step response of \\(G(s)\\) will have a steady state value of \\(K\\)).\nWe often represent the poles and zeros using a pole-zero plot.\n\nPZplot = function(zeros, poles, xdomain, ydomain) {\n  return Plot.plot({\n    grid: true,\n    x: { domain: xdomain},\n    y: { domain: ydomain},\n\n    marks: [\n      // Axes\n      Plot.ruleX([0]),\n      Plot.ruleY([0]),\n      // Data\n      Plot.dot(zeros, {x:\"σ\", y:\"jω\", r: 5}),\n      Plot.dot(poles, {x:\"σ\", y:\"jω\", symbol: \"times\", r: 5}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.1 (Pole-zero plot) Consder \\[G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{(s+1)^2 + 1^2}.\\] The poles are \\(-1 \\pm j\\) and the zero is \\(-2\\).

This is often the case when we specify a reference input such as the desired temperature of a room or the desired speed in cruise control of a car, and are interested in seeing if we get a “good” output. Note that this question is only of interest for stable systems. If the system is unstable, then the output will go to infinity.\nAs an example, consider the system of Exercise 1.2. What is the output when the input is a step function (assuming that the system starts from a zero initial state)?\nTo compute this, recall \\[\n\\mathbb{1}(t) \\xleftrightarrow{\\quad \\mathcal L\\quad} \\frac 1s.\n\\]\nThus, \\(R(s) = 1/s\\). We had already identified that \\(G(s) = 1/(s+2)\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{align*}\nC(s) &= G(s) R(s) \\\\\n     &= \\frac{1}{s(s+2)} \\\\\n     &= \\frac{ \\frac 12 }{s} - \\frac{ \\frac 12 }{ s + 2 }\n     \\quad \\text{[By partial fraction expansion]}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, \\[\n  c(t) = \\left[ \\frac 12 - \\frac 12 e^{-2t} \\right] \\mathbb{1}(t).\n\\]",
