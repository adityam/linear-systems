      Both paper and electronic versions of the textbook are available from the McGill bookstore. The electronic version of the book is also available from the publisher’s website and Google books.

  - R.L. Williams II and D.A. Lawrence, Linear State‐Space Control Systems, Wiley.

      The [electronic version of the book][LSSC] is available the library.

## Evaluation

- **Assignments (20%)** Weekly homework assignments. Typically, each assignment will consist of four questions, out of which one or two randomly selected questions will be grader. The lowest two homework assignments will be dropped.

- **Laboratory (20%)** In-person weekly labs, to be conducted in groups of two. At the end of each lab, each group has to submit a lab report by filling in a Matlab Livescript template provided as part of the lab assignment.

- **Mid Term (20%)** Closed book in-class exam.
  [**{{< meta course.mid-term >}}**]{.text-danger} (during class time)

- **Final Exam (40%)** Closed book, in-person exam. Will be scheduled by the exam office and the dates will be announced later.

    The final exam will cover **all** the material seen in the class during the term.

## Marking policy

- Assignments must be submitted electronically on myCourses as a PDF. You may write the assignments on paper and then scan them as a PDF (there are several such apps available for all phone platforms), or write on a tablet and convert to PDF, or type using a word processor.

- **There will no make-up examination** for students who miss a mid-term.

  - Student who miss the exam due to a valid reason (see [Faculty of Engineering policy][policy]) should **notify the instructor within a week** of the exam and provide **necessary documentation**.

  - If, and only if, proper documentation for a missed exam is presented, the marks for the missed exam will be shifted to the final exam.

  - Students who miss the mid-term exam for any other reason (e.g., no medical note, going to the exam at the wrong time, or on the wrong day, etc.) will get zero marks on the exam.

- Any request for reevaluation of a mid-term or an assignment must be made **in writing within a week of its return**. Note that requesting a re-grade will mean that you **WHOLE** assignment or exam will be re-graded.

- Practice is the only way to learn the material. Each assignment has 4-5 questions to help understand the material. However, according to the current grading allocation, the TA has about 3-4 minutes to grade one assignment from a student. Clearly, that's not sufficient time to grade 4-5 questions. [**So, only 1 or 2 randomly selected questions in each assignment will be graded.**]{.text-danger}


- The lowest two assignments and labs will be dropped. There will be no make-up for missed assignments and labs, _even if it is for a valid reason._ The whole point of dropping the lowest two assignments/labs is to reduce the administrative overhead of keeping track of such missed assignments/labs.


Right to submit in English or French written work that is to be graded.
: In accord with McGill University’s [Charter of Students’ Rights][charter], students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

Academic Integrity
: McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the [Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures][code] (see McGill’s [guide to academic honesty][guide] for more information).

    L’université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l’on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le [Code de conduite de l’étudiant et des procédures disciplinaires][code] (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le [guide pour l’honnêteté académique][guide] de McGill.)

## Course delivery

The course is taught in a “chalk and board” style; there will be no power point presentations. All students are expected to attend lectures and take notes. Partial notes on some of the material will be provided, but are not a substitute for the material covered in class.

© Instructor-generated course materials (e.g., handouts, notes, summaries, exam questions) are protected by law and may not be copied or distributed in any form or in any medium without explicit permission of the instructor. Note that infringements of copyright can be subject to follow up by the University under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.

## Additional Notes

- As the instructor of this course I endeavor to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course, do not hesitate to discuss them with me or contact the office of [Student Accessibility and Achievement][OSD].

- [End-of-course evaluations][evaluations] are one of the ways that McGill works towards maintaining and improving the quality of courses and the student’s learning experience. You will be notified by e-mail when the evaluations are available. Please note that a minimum number of responses must be received for results to be available to students.
